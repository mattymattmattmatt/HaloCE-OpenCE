/*
HOST_MEMORY.C

Guest address space for the PS5 port: Android's host_memory.c
(port/android/host) with the system underneath replaced by the console's,
as the Switch rewrote its own over its services. The bookkeeping is
Android's: the pools (struct pool, pool_take, pool_release), the guest's
page map (guest_pages), the rules of host_guest_mmap, the write watch and
the crash report.

What is underneath (port/ps5/PS5.md, phase 2, and phase 0 B's findings):

- Everything the guest can address is direct memory, mapped at fixed
  addresses below 4 GB: a range is reserved with
  sceKernelReserveVirtualRange (checked to have landed where asked: the
  kernel moves a reservation it cannot place), allocated with
  sceKernelAllocateDirectMemory and mapped there read-write with
  sceKernelMapDirectMemory. Flexible memory (448 MB, libc's mmap) is not
  used: direct memory is the title's one budget of 12 GB, which RADV and the
  host's own heap share.
- The guest's three fixed ranges are claimed at start-up
  (host_memory_reserve_early), before any pool: the image's
  (HALO_GUEST_IMAGE_BASE, 64 MB), Custom Edition's tag cache, and the Xbox
  window at the first 256 MB boundary from 0x80000000 where 512 MB are free
  (0x90000000 on this console: PS5_Vulkan's libc.prx holds 0x80000000). The
  guest is built with the window movable (HALO_MOVABLE_WINDOW), so it is
  told where the window is through the boot block and from then on uses
  the window's real addresses: unlike Android's, this file never moves an
  address between the two.
- Pools of 256 MB for everything else the guest maps (its malloc, thread
  stacks), each reserved whole as direct memory, in the lowest gap of the
  map at or above 16 MB, as the console's map reads (sceKernelVirtualQuery).
- Direct memory comes back holding what it held: a page is zeroed when it
  is given out (host_low_map, a guest mapping), not when it is reserved.
  Given back, it is made inaccessible (PROT_NONE) and kept: the address
  space stays reserved, as Android's does.
- Protection is libc's mprotect, which on direct memory is
  sceKernelMprotect's (phase 0 B), in the console's 16 KB pages. madvise is
  answered without a call: the guest's musl never relies on what it does.

The loader maps the image's range itself (host_loader.c: an anonymous
MAP_FIXED mmap), which on the PS5 would put flexible memory over the direct
memory reserved for it. The link wraps mmap (--wrap=mmap, tools/ps5_build.py):
__wrap_mmap answers an anonymous MAP_FIXED mapping inside the guest's
ranges by zeroing it and setting its protection, and passes every other
mapping on (RADV's, SDL2's and glslang's, above 4 GB). The first ten calls
are logged, and the counts at the end (ps5_memory_report), so phase 4 sees
whether RADV ever maps below 4 GB.

The write tracking (port/linux/src/memory_watch.c's interface) is
Android's: pages of the window write-protected, the SIGSEGV handler marking
the first write to each; a title gets the fault with its context on its
alternate stack (phase 0 B). SIGBUS is checked for a watched page too.
Other faults are reported with the registers (host_arch.c) and passed on.

/* The guest's pages are Linux's, 4 KB: its musl maps, protects and unmaps
in them. The console's are 16 KB (sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)), and a protection
is the system's for a whole one. So the guest's pages are kept in 4 KB,
with a protection each (page_protection), and each system page is given
the union of its four (set_protection): a page made inaccessible next to
one in use stays readable and writable (a guard page that does not
guard), and nothing the guest uses is ever made inaccessible. A mapping
(host_low_map) starts on a system page of its own and takes the guest's
pages it needs, so that its protections (host_thread.c's guard pages) never
reach a neighbour; the rest of its last system page is never handed out
(pool_take starts a run on a system page). It takes no more pages than an
unmap of its length gives back: when it took whole system pages, each map
of a piece (256 KB and a header) left three pages taken after its unmap,
and the freed ones were too few for the next piece, so map sharing's
download used up the pools (port/ps5/PS5.md, phase 5). */

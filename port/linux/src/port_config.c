/*
PORT_CONFIG.C

The native ports' settings (port_config.h), parsed with tomlc17
(port/third_party/tomlc17). Every setting is in the table below with its
type, default, the HALO_* environment variable that overrides it and the
comment written into a new file. The file is read once, on the first
question; unknown keys and values of the wrong type are reported in the log
and the defaults used instead, and the file itself is never rewritten once
it exists, so that the player's edits and comments stay.
